## Documentation
This is our webapp, POI, or Points of Interest.  It allows users to input a location and get relevant data in the form of weather, tweets, and attractions. The location is loaded into the database along with the relevant information and previous search terms. The buttons allow toggling of the tweets, attractions, and weather data, as well as deletion of locations, and editing them.
